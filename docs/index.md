# RA Manual

A practical guide for research assistants on using AI tools to accelerate research workflows.

## What This Manual Covers

This manual teaches you how to use **Claude Code** — an AI coding assistant — inside VS Code to write, debug, and review research code. It covers setup, core workflow practices, and the lab's coding standards.

AI is a force multiplier for research. Used well, it can dramatically speed up data cleaning, code writing, debugging, and even help you implement economic models from paper descriptions. Used poorly, it produces plausible-looking garbage. This manual shows you how to use it well.

## Pages

1. **[Setup](01-setup.md)** — Install VS Code and Claude Code. Takes ~10 minutes.
2. **[Why Claude Code?](02-why-claude-code.md)** — What makes this tool useful for research, with concrete examples.
3. **[Core Workflow](03-workflow.md)** — The practices that matter: `CLAUDE.md` files, plan mode, sub-agents, and compound engineering.
4. **[Code Principles](04-code-principles.md)** — Project organization and coding standards for the lab.
5. **[Resources](05-resources.md)** — Links to documentation and planned future extensions.

## Quick Start

If you just want to get going fast:

1. Follow the [Setup](01-setup.md) page to install everything
2. Read [Why Claude Code?](02-why-claude-code.md) to understand what it can do
3. Read the [Core Workflow](03-workflow.md) section on **plan mode** — this is the most important habit to build
4. Keep the [Code Principles](04-code-principles.md) page bookmarked as a reference
