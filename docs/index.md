# RA Manual

A practical guide for research assistants on using AI tools.

---

## Key Principles

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-clipboard-check-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Always plan first__

    ---

    Never let AI start coding immediately. Use plan mode to research, identify the right approach, and write a plan for your approval.

-   :material-speedometer:{ .lg .middle } __Mind your model usage__

    ---

    Default to Sonnet—you'll burn through credits fast with Opus. Save Opus for complex reasoning only.

-   :material-language-markdown:{ .lg .middle } __Work in markdown__

    ---

    Markdown files are easy for AI to read and edit. Use them for notes, docs, and task lists. AI works better with markdown than Word or PDFs.

-   :material-cog-refresh:{ .lg .middle } __Create skills for repetitive tasks__

    ---

    When you repeat the same instructions, create a skill (reusable prompt template). Build your personal library over time.

-   :material-sync:{ .lg .middle } __Use compound engineering__

    ---

    *Plan → Work → Assess → Compound.* After each task, ask "what could we do better?" and write learnings to `CLAUDE.md`. The AI gets smarter over time.

-   :material-account-multiple:{ .lg .middle } __Use sub-agents liberally__

    ---

    Spawn specialized sub-agents for research, exploration, and parallel tasks. Don't do everything in one thread.

-   :material-calendar-check:{ .lg .middle } __Keep a weekly task list__

    ---

    Maintain a markdown file: *This Week* (what you did + links) and *Next Week* (what you're planning). Share with your supervisor before each meeting.

-   :material-book-open-page-variant:{ .lg .middle } __Keep up with best practices__

    ---

    AI tools evolve rapidly. Read the [official docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) regularly. Last month's best practice may be outdated.

-   :material-microphone:{ .lg .middle } __Use voice-to-text__

    ---

    Speak at ~150 wpm vs typing ~50 wpm. Use [Wispr Flow](https://www.wispr.ai/) to 3x your input speed.
